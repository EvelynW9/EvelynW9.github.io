            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My mission is to grow as a computer engineer while using creativity and curiosity to design 
technology that makes a difference. I believe keeping life fun and imaginative makes my 
work stronger. At retirement, I hope to be remembered as someone who worked with 
integrity, inspired others, and kept the joy in learning and creating.</p>
