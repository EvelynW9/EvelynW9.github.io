            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My mission is to grow as a computer engineer while using creativity and curiosity to design 
            technology that makes a difference. I believe keeping life fun and imaginative makes my 
            work stronger. At retirement, I hope to be remembered as someone who worked with 
            integrity, inspired others, and kept the joy in learning and creating.</p>

                <p>USC students need a way to conveniently call attention to/report problems regarding
                    campus or any other university-related problems, as there is no current streamlined
                    method.

                    The planning for a reporting app is summed up in this paper, with an emphasis on the 
                    app's design and intended functions. Important things include making sure the software can stop repression 
                    and putting in place a suitable moderation system to
                    handle the risk that users would treat it like social media.

                <p>
                The designs depict the app's two key user flows: creating a post (a petition with a signature goal) 
                and marking a problem on a map.
                The posting flow contains screens for logging in and creating posts, 
                as well as a signature notification system for tracking milestones.
